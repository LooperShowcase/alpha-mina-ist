    <h2>Animals we see daily that evolved over the ages</h1>

    <h2>by: Mina Istaitih</h2>
    <h3>first of all</h3>
    <p>
      all around the world there is animals that have evolved over the ages like
      cats, dogs and plenty more animals.<br> a lot of animals that we think are
      made by god that way tecnekly haven't ben made the way we see it today,
      they were so much difrent before.

    <p>Ideas aimed at explaining how organisms change, or evolve, over time date back to Anaximander of Miletus, a Greek philosopher who lived in the 500s B.C.E.<br> Noting that human babies are born helpless, Anaximander speculated that humans must have descended from some other type of creature whose young could survive without any help.<br> He concluded that those ancestors must be fish, since fish hatch from eggs and immediately begin living with no help from their parents.<br> From this reasoning, he proposed that all life began in the sea.<br>

    Anaximander was correct; humans can indeed trace our ancestry back to fish. His idea, however, was not a theory in the scientific meaning of the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might support it or prove it wrong.<br> In science, the word “theory” indicates a very high level of certainty.<br> Scientists talk about evolution as a theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of gravity as a theory.<br>
    
    A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed to prove the idea right or wrong.<br> When it comes to the evolution of life, various philosophers and scientists, including an eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory.<br> But evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous book On the Origin of Species.<br> Darwin and a scientific contemporary of his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a phenomenon called natural selection.<br>
    
    In the theory of natural selection, organisms produce more offspring than are able to survive in their environment.<br>
     Those that are better physically equipped to survive, grow to maturity, and reproduce.<br>
      Those that are lacking in such fitness, on the other hand, either do not reach an age when they can reproduce or
       produce fewer offspring than their counterparts.<br>
        Natural selection is sometimes summed up as “survival of the fittest” because the “fittest” organisms—those most
         suited to their environment—are the ones that reproduce most successfully, a
         nd are most likely to pass on their traits to the next generation.<br>ss
    
    This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance survival in that environment will
     also gradually change, or evolve.<br> Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the
      evolution of life that it became established as a scientific theory.<br> Biologists have since observed
       numerous examples of natural selection influencing evolution.<br> Today, it is known to be just one of several
        mechanisms by which life evolves.<br> For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift can also cause species to
         evolve.<br> In genetic drift, some organisms—purely by chance—produce more offspring than would be expected.<br>
          Those organisms are not necessarily
     the fittest of their species, but it is their genes that get passed on to the next generation.</p>
